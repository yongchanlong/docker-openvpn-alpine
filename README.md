# A simple<sup>*</sup> [SoftEther VPN][1] server Docker image

<sup>*</sup> "Simple" as in no configuration parameter is needed for a single-user SecureNAT setup.

## Setup
 - OpenVPN
 - SecureNAT enabled
 - Perfect Forward Secrecy (DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA)
 - make'd from [the official SoftEther VPN GitHub Stable Edition Repository][2].

`docker run -d --cap-add NET_ADMIN -e SPW=123 -e HPW=123 -e USERS=user:123 -p 5555:5555 -p 1194:1194 andrewai/docker-openvpn-alpine`

Connectivity tested on Android + iOS devices. 

The above example will accept connections from OpenVPN clients at the same time.

Mix and match published ports: 
- `-p 1194:1194/tcp` for OpenVPN.
- `-p 5555:5555/tcp` for SoftEther VPN (recommended by vendor).

Any protocol supported by SoftEther VPN server is accepted at any open/published port (if VPN client allows non-default ports).

## Credentials

All optional:

- `-e PSK`: Pre-Shared Key (PSK), if not set: "notasecret" (without quotes) by default.
- `-e USERS`: Multiple usernames and passwords may be set with the following pattern: `username:password;user2:pass2;user3:pass3`. Username and passwords are separated by `:`. Each pair of `username:password` should be separated by `;`. If not set a single user account with a random username ("user[nnnn]") and a random weak password is created.
- `-e SPW`: Server management password. :warning:
- `-e HPW`: "DEFAULT" hub management password. :warning:

Single-user mode (usage of `-e USERNAME` and `-e PASSWORD`) is still supported.

See the docker log for username and password (unless `-e USERS` is set), which *would look like*:

    # ========================
    # user6301
    # 2329.2890.3101.2451.9875
    # ========================
Dots (.) are part of the password. Password will not be logged if specified via `-e USERS`; use `docker inspect` in case you need to see it.

:warning: if not set a random password will be set but not displayed nor logged. If specifying read the notice below.

#### Notice ####

If you specify credentials using environment variables (`-e`), they may be revealed via the process list on host (ex. `ps(1)` command) or `docker inspect` command. It is recommended to mount an already-configured SoftEther VPN config file at `/opt/vpn_server.config`, which contains hashed passwords rather than raw ones. The initial setup will be skipped if this file exists at runtime (in entrypoint script). You can obtain this file from a running container using [`docker cp` command](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/cp/).

## Server & Hub Management Commands ##

Management commands can be executed just before the server & hub admin passwords are set via:
- `-e VPNCMD_SERVER`: `;`-separated [Server management commands](https://www.softether.org/4-docs/1-manual/6._Command_Line_Management_Utility_Manual/6.3_VPN_Server_%2F%2F_VPN_Bridge_Management_Command_Reference_(For_Entire_Server)).
- `-e VPNCMD_HUB`: `;`-separated [Hub management commands](https://www.softether.org/4-docs/1-manual/6._Command_Line_Management_Utility_Manual/6.4_VPN_Server_%2F%2F_VPN_Bridge_Management_Command_Reference_(For_Virtual_Hub)) (currently only for `DEFAULT` hub).

Example: Set MTU via [`NatSet`](https://www.softether.org/4-docs/1-manual/6._Command_Line_Management_Utility_Manual/6.4_VPN_Server_%2F%2F_VPN_Bridge_Management_Command_Reference_(For_Virtual_Hub)#6.4.97_.22NatSet.22:_Change_Virtual_NAT_Function_Setting_of_SecureNAT_Function) Hub management command:
`-e VPNCMD_HUB='NatSet /MTU:1500'`

Note that commands run only if the config file is not mounted. Some commands (like `ServerPasswordSet`) will cause problems.

## OpenVPN ##

`docker run -d --cap-add NET_ADMIN -p 1194:1194/udp andrewai/docker-openvpn-alpine`

The entire log can be saved and used as an `.ovpn` config file (change as needed).

Server CA certificate will be created automatically at runtime if it's not set. You can supply _a self-signed 1024-bit RSA certificate/key pair_ created locally OR use the `gencert` script described below. Feed the keypair contents via `-e CERT` and `-e KEY` ([use of `--env-file`][3] is recommended). X.509 markers (like `-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----`) and any non-BASE64 character (incl. newline) can be omitted and will be ignored.

Examples (assuming bash; note the double-quotes `"` and backticks `` ` ``):

* ``-e CERT="`cat server.crt`" -e KEY="`cat server.key`"``
* `-e CERT="MIIDp..b9xA=" -e KEY="MIIEv..x/A=="`
* `--env-file /path/to/envlist`

`env-file` template can be generated by:

`docker run --rm siomiz/softethervpn gencert > /path/to/envlist`

The output will have `CERT` and `KEY` already filled in. Modify `PSK`/`USERS`.

Certificate volumes support (like `-v` or `--volumes-from`) will be added at some point...
